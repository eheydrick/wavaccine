# WA Vaccine Guide

## Aggregators

These sites scrape availability from multiple sites, saving you the trouble of checking them individually.

* [WA Vaccine Finder - covidwa.com](https://www.covidwa.com/) - 860+ providers checked every 5 minutes. Also available as a [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/covidwashington) with hash tags for each county. For instance [#CovidWaKingCounty](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidWaKingCounty) has real-time updates as appointments open up in King County.

* [Vaccine Spotter](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/WA/) - Good for checking pharmacy chains (Rite Aid, Walgreens, Costco, Walmart, etc.)

* [Vaccine Finder](https://vaccinefinder.org/search/) - Good for pharmacy chains.

## Pharmacy Chains

Pharmacy chains part of the [Federal Retail Pharmacy Program](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/retail-pharmacy-program/participating-pharmacies.html) include Kroger (Fred Meyer, QFC) and Albertsons (Safeway). Usually better to use the aggregators but if you really prefer one chain over the other, these can be checked individually.
